The reason for initiating this research is that airports operate on very strict schedules, and verifying a person's authorization at security checkpoints can be a challenging task when relying solely on online models. To address this issue, I propose an autonomous agent solution that utilizes a multi-model concept, incorporating facial, fingerprint, and voice biometrics, as well as passport documents, to compare physical appearances at the airport. The use of a multi-model concept will ensure a high level of accuracy in identifying individuals, and the integration of various biometric technologies will provide an additional layer of security. Facial recognition technology can be used to match an individual's face to their passport photo, while fingerprint and voice biometrics can be used to further verify their identity. In combination with passport documents, this system will significantly enhance the overall security of airport checkpoints.</p>

## AI-powered biometric authentication can be achieved without any hassle using an automated system.

Moreover, the use of autonomous agents will reduce the need for manual verification and human intervention, thereby minimizing the risk of errors and delays. The proposed system will provide a faster, more efficient, and secure method for verifying travelers' identities at airports.
Face recognition and document verification using a multi-agent system is a cutting-edge technology that is revolutionizing the field of biometric security. This technology allows for the identification and verification of individuals with an unprecedented level of accuracy and speed. The multi-agent system works by using multiple agents, each with their own specialized task, to carry out the face recognition and document verification process.</p>
  <p align="justify">
The face recognition component of the system involves the use of advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze an individual's facial features and match them with a pre-existing database of known faces. This process is incredibly fast and can identify individuals in real-time, making it an ideal solution for security applications. The document verification component of the system involves the use of specialized sensors and software to analyze the authenticity of various types of documents, such as passports, IDs, and visas. This technology can detect fake or altered documents with a high degree of accuracy and can help prevent identity fraud and other forms of criminal activity.</p>
  <p align="justify">
In conclusion, the integration of autonomous agents with a multi-model concept incorporating various biometric technologies and passport documents is a promising solution to the challenges posed by airport security checkpoints. It will ensure a high level of accuracy, speed, and security while reducing the need for human intervention.
